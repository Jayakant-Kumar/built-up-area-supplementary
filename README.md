# Supplementary Material: Built-Up Area Estimation

This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper:

**"Built-Up Area Estimation from Handheld RGB-D Sensing Enabled by Vision Foundation Models"**

submitted to *IEEE Sensors Letters*.

## Contents
- `supplementary_material.pdf`  
  Detailed per-building results, additional figures, and evaluation statistics
  supporting the main paper.

## Description
The supplementary document provides extended quantitative results for building
facade width and footprint area estimation using handheld RGB video and a
Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth sensor. The main pipeline integrates Grounding DINO
for building detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for facade
segmentation.
